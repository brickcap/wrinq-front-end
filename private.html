      <h1>wrinq and privacy</h1>
      <p>
	Wrinq allows you to communicate privately to your friends,
	family or customers.You can send messages or engage in
	audio/video calls.Your privacy is ensured on several different levels. 
      </p>
      <p>
	First, wrinq collects very little information about you. When
	you sign up for the service you need to fill only two fields
	in the form. A username and a password. There is an optional
	third field that you can fill if you like which is  your 
	email address, just in case you forget your
	password and need to retreive it. That's it. It never asks
	or stores any other detail about you.
      </p>
      <p>
	Any voice or video calls that you make through wrinq are
	unmonitored and take place over a peer to peer
	connection using web rtc. 
      </p>
      <p>
	Any messages that you send from wrinq to your contact are
	stored locally in your browser and the browser of the person
	to whom you have sent the message. Messages are not stored on
	wrinq's database ever.   
      </p>
      <p>
	Profiles are optional and should you choose to create one it will be
	stored right in your browser. Profiles are exchanged when you
	accept requests from other users. Again the exchange of
	profiles take place over a peer to peer connection using web
	rtc. Once exchanged the profile of your contact will also be stored
	locally in your browser. Like messages wrinq does not store
	any profile on it's database.
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>In short wrinq gives you a complete control of your data</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
	Now I understand that what you are reading can be a bit hard to
	believe and I can understand the scepticism. To gain you trust I have
	open sourced 90% of wrinq.

	The messaging server that is resposible for routing calls is open
	sourced under the name 

	<a href="https://github.com/brickcap/wrinqle">wrinqle</a>.

	The UI is open sourced as 
	<a href="https://github.com/brickcap/wrinq-front-end">wrinqle-front-end</a>.
	Please contribute and help me make wrinq successful.
      </p>
      <p>Thanks.</p>
